Types in ts

--Primitive Types
* any
* unknown
* number 
* string
* boolean
* bigint

-- Type Inference : Type inference is a feature in TypeScript that allows the compiler to automatically 
                    infer the type of a variable or expression based on the context (declaration) in which it is used.


--Object Types
* Objects
* Type aliases
* Union Types
* Union & primitives
* Intersections
* Index signatures

--Arrays
* Arrays
* Tuples
* Readonly

--Advanced Types
* null
* undefined
* void
* never
* enum


--- In TS unknown is better than any why?
Because, TS won't let us perform any of the operation till we are sure about 
the type of the value we are dealing with.
